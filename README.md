# Build an ecommerce Website
* Orinoco, Handmade teddy bear ecommerce website build using Vanilla JavaScript with no libraries, HTML5 CSS3 and Bootstrap 5.
The website is an initial MVP to develope with a test plan covering features to test and not to test.
* This is my 5th project on my path learning web development, It is mostly focused on using pure javascript to build a dynamic front end,i learned:<br/>- Working with API's displaying and posting data using FETCH <br/>- URL Search parameters <br/>- Storing and getting data from locaStorage to build a shopping cart<br/>- Forms Data validation writing a test plan
## Architecture 
The front end will require 4 pages:
* A list view page, showing all items available for sale.
* A single product page, which will dynamically show the item selected by the user, display a description and price in dollars, and allow users to personalize the product and add it to their cart.
* A cart page (using the localStorage JavaScript functionality), showing a summary of products in the cart, the total price, and a form with which to submit an order.
* An order confirmation page, thanking the user for their order, showing the total price and the order ID returned by the server.
## Installation to run the server
From within the project folder, run npm install. You can then run the server with node server. The server should run on localhost with default port 3000.
